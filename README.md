# Welcome

Welcome to The Openpilot Documentation Project.

The open source initiative to document [commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot), hardware and the vehicles it supports... all while aiming to be written for people of any skill level.

Our documents and guides will try not to assume prior knowledge of any specific term or topic (within reason).

## Why

The current goals of the openpilot project have a lot to do with progress and prototyping to move the technology forward and very few people are interested in moving the on-boarding experience forward.  That's nobody's fault really, it's just the facts.

So the goal is to bring a fresh take to the on-boarding experience to the table.

What better way to do that than with GitHub and some Markdown.

## What is Openpilot?

openpilot is an open source driving assistant. Currently it can be used as an after-market alternative to perform the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) for Hondas, Acuras, Toyotas, and a Chevy. It's about on par with Tesla Autopilot and GM Super Cruise, and better than all other manufacturers.

The openpilot codebase has been written to be concise and enable rapid prototyping. We look forward to your contributions - improving real vehicle automation has never been easier.

## Help create documentation

Your contributions to the documentation are always welcome and will continue to make this a necessary resource for newcomers and veterans alike.
