It passes through the signals to the existing driver assistance system. Or turn the switches off and block the signals. It&#x27;s like unplugging, but better. Or proxy the signals through your panda. When used with a chffr panda you get more signals and access to read from your car&#x27;s radar.

Also has a NEO compatible fake ethernet port with access to CAN1, CAN2, started detect, +12v, and ground.
