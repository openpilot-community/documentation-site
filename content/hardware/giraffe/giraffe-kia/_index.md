title: Giraffe (Kia)
---

The Giraffe is responsible for passing through signals to your vehicles existing driver assistance system. 

It features small toggle switches that allow you to turn the individual pass-throughs on or off to block the signals.  This saves you from having to physically unplug or detach anything from the vehicle to resume using the stock system. It&#x27;s like unplugging, but better. 

It also allows you to optionally proxy the signals through to your [Panda](/hardware/panda/).  When used with a [White Panda](/hardware/panda/panda-white/) you&#x27;re able to get more signals and access to read from your car&#x27;s radar.

It also has a NEO compatible fake ethernet port with access to CAN1, CAN2, started detect, +12v, and ground.

!! A note on the FAKE ethernet port:
!! DO NOT use this to connect to your laptop or network.

This giraffe is custom built by community members for Kia models matching similar hardware as the 2018 Kia Sorento and 2018 Kia Stinger.
