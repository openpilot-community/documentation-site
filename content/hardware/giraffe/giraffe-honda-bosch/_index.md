title: Giraffe (Honda Bosch)
---

The Giraffe is responsible for passing through signals to your vehicles existing driver assistance system. 

It features small toggle switches that allow you to turn the individual pass-throughs on or off to block the signals.  This saves you from having to physically unplug or detach anything from the vehicle to resume using the stock system. It&#x27;s like unplugging, but better. 

It also allows you to optionally proxy the signals through to your [Panda](/hardware/panda/).  When used with a [White Panda](/hardware/panda/panda-white/) you&#x27;re able to get more signals and access to read from your car&#x27;s radar.

It also has a NEO compatible fake ethernet port with access to CAN1, CAN2, started detect, +12v, and ground.

!! A note on the FAKE ethernet port:
!! DO NOT use this to connect to your laptop or network.

This giraffe is designed for new model year Honda/Acura cars that have Honda Sensing/AcuraWatch Plus and Bosch hardware, which is found on the following cars Honda Civic Hatchback, 2017+ Honda CR-V, and 2018+ Honda Accord It may also work on other cars with the same connector. 
(Honda Bosch ships in 2-8 weeks)
