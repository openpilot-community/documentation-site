## What is a Giraffe
The Giraffe is responsible for passing through signals to your vehicles existing driver assistance system. 

It features small toggle switches that allow you to turn the individual pass-throughs on or off to block the signals.  This saves you from having to physically unplug or detach anything from the vehicle to resume using the stock system. It&#x27;s like unplugging, but better. 

It also allows you to optionally proxy the signals through to your [Panda](/hardware/panda/).  When used with a [White Panda](/hardware/panda/panda-white/) you&#x27;re able to get more signals and access to read from your car&#x27;s radar.

It also has a NEO compatible fake ethernet port with access to CAN1, CAN2, started detect, +12v, and ground.

!! A note on the FAKE ethernet port:
!! DO NOT use this to connect to your laptop or network.
