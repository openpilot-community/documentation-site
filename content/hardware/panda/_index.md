Panda is the nicest universal car interface ever. It allows you full access to the many communication buses of your car from a computer or a phone.

Panda+cabana (https://cabana.comma.ai/) is like a fitness tracker for your car. Track your RPMs, MPG, cornering G-force, battery life, and so much more.
