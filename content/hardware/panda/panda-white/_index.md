This is the White Panda.  It has USB and WiFi connectivity.
It is not necessarily the recommended Panda now a days for using with Openpilot.

It works great for interfacing with your vehicle and hacking against it but it is not the best experience for openpilot seeking users.

Keep this in mind.

panda is designed for cars 2008 and newer. panda firmware is released under the MIT license.

## What is a Panda
Panda is the nicest universal car interface ever. It allows you full access to the many communication buses of your car from a computer or a phone.

Panda+cabana (https://cabana.comma.ai/) is like a fitness tracker for your car. Track your RPMs, MPG, cornering G-force, battery life, and so much more.

However, we haven't found plans for the White Panda but will post them if / when we can make them available.

## Compatible Vehicles

This hardware is known to generally work with all fairly modern vehicles.
