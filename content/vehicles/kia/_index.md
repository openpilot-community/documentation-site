The goal is to always support as many vehicles as possible.

To chat about Kia's with the community, checkout the [#hyundai](slack://channel?id=hyundai&team=comma) channel in the [Comma Slack](https://slack.comma.ai).
## Compatible models

## How to add support for a vehicle

If you own an unsupported vehicle but are interested in discussing porting it to openpilot, join us in the *NEW* [openpilot community chat support system](https://spectrum.chat/openpilot) and the always popular [Comma.ai Slack](https://slack.comma.ai/) if you prefer it.

There will also be some great info on porting models in [Development Guides](../../development/guides/).
