The goal is to always support as many vehicles as possible.

## Compatible models

This is the current list of models being tested and/or actively supported by either community members or Comma.ai.  Varying levels of support / testing are being done on the listed models so please review them thoroughly.

* [C-HR](/vehicles/toyota/c-hr/)
* [Camry](/vehicles/toyota/camry/)
* [Corolla](/vehicles/toyota/corolla/)
* [Prius](/vehicles/toyota/prius/)

## How to add support for a vehicle

If you own an unsupported vehicle but are interested in discussing porting it to openpilot, join us in the *NEW* [openpilot community chat support system](https://spectrum.chat/openpilot) and the always popular [Comma.ai Slack](https://slack.comma.ai/) if you prefer it.

There will also be some great info on porting models in [Development Guides](../../development/guides/).
